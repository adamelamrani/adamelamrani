### About me

<p>
  Welcome to my GitHub's profile! I am a fullstack developer from Spain, currently living in Valencia. My baby steps in the world of programming started in 2022, when I decided to join a programming Bootcamp.
      That was for me a new beginning in my life, and I will always be grateful for everything that I've learned there.
      Now that I have already a couple of years of working experience, I decided to start a degree in Techniques for Software Application Development in the <a href="https://uoc.edu" target="_blank">Open University of Catalonia (UOC)</a>, to keep learning and improving my skills.
